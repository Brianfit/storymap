# storymap

A simple javascript and HTML5 canvas page for filling in a "Hero's Journey" story map and creating an 
image you can then download and distribute. 

The Hero's Journey is one of the most common story arcs in the world and one which can 
be useful for <strong>creating a simple schematic to explain an activist campaign to fundraisers, 
communicators, and political operatives</strong>. If everyone understands the monster you're fighting, 
the values you're expressing, the moral you're working towards, the broken world you're trying to fix, 
the vision of a healed world you're trying to deliver, and the hero that's going to deliver it, you can 
simplify many of the routine tasks of running a campaign and present a more consistent and effective 
public profile.<br /><br /><strong>Instructions:</strong> Fill out the fields below the image with your story's 
elements. When you click 'Submit' the fields will appear in the image. 

All done? Click the 'Take Snapshot' button to generate an image you can download.

To Do: Aesthetics. This is a pretty plain canvas without much customisation. If anyone wants to add font, size, 
and color selectors that would help. Some of my centering and layout is pretty primitive too. 

Mobile compatibility. Uff. Canvas resizing with reorientation of a mobile device is HARD. Especially when the final product needs to layout text relative to a position on the image. If anybody wants to tackle that, yay!
